# WordPress GitHub Sync Extra #

## Description ##

Built to add extra functionality to https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/wordpress-github-sync for serval projects at Mesoshpere

*A work in progess*

### WordPress GitHub Sync Extra has 5 Modules: ###

1. *Sync Branch*: Adds an option to the admin page to allow the user to specify the branch to be used when syncing.

2. *Sync Meta*: Updates and filers post meta flowing in both directions. Meta and custom fields have to be specifically allowed before being synced.

3. *Sync Parent Path*: Syncs hierarchy in Wordpress to folder sturcture in git. Post parents are no longer assigned in meta, but by the folder structure ( for pages ).

4. *Sync Image Path*: Imports images from git and converts tag markup to Wordpress theme.

5. *Sync File Name*: Ties the filename in git to the slug in Wordpress ( Currently this is only working in one direction, git -> Wordpress ).
